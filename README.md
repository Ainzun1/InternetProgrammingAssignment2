# CSS Dynamic WEBSITE - INTERNET PROGRAMMMING 

In this assignment I had to Create a web-page that consists of dynamic features, i.e., a signup form that is associated with mySQL table named "NewUsers". The form can be used to post data to mySQL table and fetch data from mySQL table displaying it on a webpage. Language to be used is "PHP" ONLY.

The tools I used were Notepad++, USB-Webserver program, w3-schools website for some formatting.
